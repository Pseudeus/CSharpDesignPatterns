GoF Definition:
    Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
    
Concept:
    This pattern is also known as the Handle/Body pattern. With it, you decouple an
    implementation class from an abstract class by providing a bridge between them.
        This bridge interface makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from
    the interface implementer classes. You can alter different kinds of classes structurally
    without affection each other.
