GoF Definition:
    Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor
    lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it
    operates.
    
Concept:
    Whith this pattern, you separate an algorithm from an object structure. So, you can add
    new operations without modifying the existing architecture. This patten supports the
    open/close principle (which says extension is allowed but modification is disallowed for
    entities shuch a class, function, modules, and so on).
