GoF Definition:
    Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes
    state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    
Concept:
    In this pattern, there are many observers (objects) that are observing a particular subject
    (also an object). Observers want to be notified when there is a change made inside 
    the subject. So, they register themselves to that subject. When they lose interest in the
    subject, they simply unregister from the subject. Sometimes this model is referred as the
    Publisher/Suscriber model. The whole idea can be summarized as follows: using this
    pattern, an object (subject) can send notifications to multiple observers (a set of objects)
    at the same time.
