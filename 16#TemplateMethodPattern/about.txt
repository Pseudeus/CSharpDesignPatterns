GoF Definition:
    Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
    The Template Method pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm
    without changing the algorithm's structure.
    
Concept:
    With the template method pattern, you define the minimum or essential structure of an
    algorithm. Then you defer some responsability to the subclasses. The key idea is that you
    can redefine certain steps of an algorithm, but thos changes will not impact the core
    architecture.
        This design pattern is useful if you have to implement a multistep algorithm and you
    want to allow customization through subclasses.
