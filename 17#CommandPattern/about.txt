GoF Definition:
    Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with
    different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
    
Concept:
    With this pattern, you encapsulate a method invocation process. In general, four terms
    are important here: invoker, client, command, and receiver:
    
        *   A command object can invoke a method of the receiver in a way that is specific
            to that receiver's class.
            
        *   The receiver then starts processing the job.
        
        *   A command object is separately passed to the invoker object to invoke the command.
        
        *   The client object holds the invoker object and the command objects. The client
            only makes the decision (which commands to execute) and then passes the 
            command to the invoker object (for execution).
