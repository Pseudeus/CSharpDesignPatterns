GoF Definition:
    Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentally without
    exposing its underlying representation.
    
Concept:
    Iterator are Generally used to travers a container (which is basically an object) to
    access its elements, but you do not need to deal with the element's internal details. You
    will frequently use the concepts of iterators when you want to traverse different kinds of
    collection objects in a standard an uniform way.
    
        *   This concept is used frequently to traverse the nodes of a tree-like
            structure. So, in many scenarios, you may notice the use of the 
            Iterator pattern with the Composite pattern.
        
        *   C# has its own iterators that were introduced in Visual Studio 2005.
            The foreach statement is frequenly used in this context. 
            
        *   If you are familiar with java, you may have already used java's built-in
            Iterator interface.
