GoF Definition:
    Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new 
    objects by copying this prototype.
    
Concept:
    This pattern provides an alternative method for instantiating new objects by copying or 
    cloning an instance of an existing object. You can avoid the expense of creating a new
    instance using this concept.
