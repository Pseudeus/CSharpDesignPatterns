GoF Definition:
    Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes
    loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you
    vary their interaction indepently.
    
Concept:
    A mediator takes responsibility for controlling and coordinating the interactions of
    a specific group of objects that cannot refer each other explicitly. In other words, a
    mediator is an intermediary through whom these objects talk to each other. This kind of
    implementation helps you to reduce the number of interconnections among different
    objects. As a result, you can reduce the coupling in the system.
