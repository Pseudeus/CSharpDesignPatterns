GoF Definition:
    Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a
    chance to hancle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the
    chain until an object handles it.
    
Concept:
    In this pattern, you form a chain of objects where each object in the chain can handle
    a particular kind of request. If an object cannot handle the request fully, it passes the 
    request to the next object in the chain. This process may contiunue until the end of the
    chain. This kind of request-handling mechanism gives you the flexibiity to add a new
    processing object (handler) at the end of the chain.
