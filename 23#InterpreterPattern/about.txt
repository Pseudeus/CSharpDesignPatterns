GoF Definition:
    Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that
    uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
    
Concept:
    This pattern deals with evualuating sentences in a language. You need to define a
    grammar to represent the language, and then the interpreter will deal with that grammar.
    For example, in this example, you will transform a three-digit integer that is input into its 
    equivalent word form (in other words, a string).
