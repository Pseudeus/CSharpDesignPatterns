GoF Definition:
    Create an object without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
    
Concept:
    In object-oriented programming, a factory is such an object that can create other objects.
    A factory can be invoked in may different ways but most often, it uses a method that 
    can return objects with varying prototypes. Any subroutine that can help us to create
    these new objects, can be considered as a factory. Most importantly, it will help you to
    abstract the process of object creation from the consumer of the application.
