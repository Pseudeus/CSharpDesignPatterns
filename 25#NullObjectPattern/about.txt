GoF Definition:
    There is no universally accepted definition. So, let's choose the definiton from
    wikipedia which says the following:
        
        "In object-oriented cumputer programming, a null object is an object with
         no referenced value or with defined neutral ('null') behavior. The null object
         design pattern describes the uses of such objects and their behavior (or lack
         thereof). It was first published in the Pattern Languages of Program Design
         book series."
    
Concept:
    The pattern can implement a "do-nothing" relationship, or it can provide a default
    behavior when an application encounters a null object instead of a real object. In simple
    words, the core aim is to make a better solution by avoiding a "null objects check" or
    "null collaborations check" through if blocks.
        To explain the concept better, I will explain the problems associated with the
    following program (which is basically a faulty program), analyze the probable solutions,
    and, ultimately, implement the concept of this design pattern.
