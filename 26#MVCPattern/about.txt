GoF Definition:
    There is no universally accepted definition. So, let's choose the definiton from two
    commonly used resources. Wikipedia says the following:
        
        "Model-view-controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly used
         for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three inter-
         connected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of infor-
         mation from the way information is presented to and accepted from the
         user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing
         for efficent code reuse and parallel development."
         
         wiki.c2.com says this: "We need smart models, thin controllers and dumb views."
    
Concept:
    From the definition, it is apparent that the pattern consists of these major components:
    model, view, and controller. The controller is placed between the view and model in
    such a way that they can communicate to each other only through the controller. This
    model separates the machanism of how the data is displayed from the mechanism of
    how the data will be manipulated.
