Gof Definition:
    Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same
    construction processes can create different representations.
    
Concept:
    The Builder pattern is useful for creating complex objects that have multiple parts.
    The creation process of an object should be independent of these parts; in other words,
    the construction process does not care how these parts are assembled. In addition, you
    should be able to use the same construction process to create different representations
    of the objects.
