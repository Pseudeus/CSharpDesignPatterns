GoF Definition:
    Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
    specifying their concrete classes.
    
Concept:
    An abstract factory is called a 'factory of factoryes'. In this pattern, you provide a way to
    encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme. In this process,
    you do not mention or specify their concrete classes.
        This pattern helps you to interchange specific implementations without changing
    the code that uses them, even at runtime. However, it may result in unnecessary
    complexity and extra work. Even debugging becomes tough in some cases.
