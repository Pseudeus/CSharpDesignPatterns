GoF Definition:
    Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
    
Concept:
    A proxy ys basically a substitute for an intended object. When a client deals with a proxy
    object, it thinks that it is dealing with the actual object. You need to support this kind of 
    design because dealing with an original object is not alway possible. This is because of
    many factory such as security issues, for example. So, in this pattern, you may want to
    use a class that can perform as an interface to something else.
