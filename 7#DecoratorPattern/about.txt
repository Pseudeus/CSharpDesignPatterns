GoF Definition:
    Attach additional responsabilities to an object dynamically. Decorator provide a flexible
    alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    
Concept:
    This pattern promotes the concept that your clas should be closed for modification
    but open for extension. In other words, you can add a functionality without disturbing
    the existing functionalities. The concept is useful when you want to add some special
    functionality to a specific object instead of the whole class. This pattern prefers object
    composition over inheritance. Once you master this technique, you can add new 
    responsabilities to an object without affecting the underlying classes.
